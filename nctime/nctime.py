        NetCDF files describe all dimensions necessary to work with. In the climate community, this format is widely
        used following the `CF conventions <http://cfconventions.org/>`_. Dimensions such as longitude, latitude and
        time are included in NetCDF files as vectors.|n|n

        The time axis is a key dimension. Unfortunately, this time axis often is mistaken in files from coupled climate
        models and leads to flawed studies or unused data. Consequently, these files cannot be used or, even worse,
        produced erroneous results, due to problems in the time axis description.|n|n

        Moreover, to produce smaller files, the NetCDF files are splitted over the time period. Consequently, the
        different MIP archives designs include the period dates into the filename. The scheme of chunked files in MIP
        projects is not fixed and depends on several parameters (the institute, the model, the frequency, etc.). These
        different schemes lead to unnecessary overlapping files with a more complex folder reading and wasting disk
        space.|n|n

        "nctime" is a Python toolbox allowing you to easily:|n
         - Highlight chunked NetCDF files producing overlaps in a time series and delete all chunked overlapping
         files,|n
         - Check and rebuild a MIP-compliant time axis of your NetCDF files.|n|n

        Note that "nctime" is based on uncorrupted filename period dates and properly-defined times units, time
        calendar and frequency NetCDF attributes.|n|n
